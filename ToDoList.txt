-----Project To-Do List-----

1. Install SDL

You'll have to install a few other things in order for it to work. While using the pi, type in the following:

sudo apt-get install mercurial
hg clone https://hg.libsdl.org/SDL SDL
cd SDL
mkdir build
cd build
sudo apt-get install libxext-dev
../configure
make
sudo make install

Overall, it will take around 30 minutes to complete.
